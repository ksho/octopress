"When a man walks into a room, he brings his whole life with him. He has a  million reasons for being anywhere. Just ask him. If you listen, he'll  tell you how he got there. How he forgot where he was going. And then he  woke up. If you listen he'll tell you about the time he thought he was  an angel and dreamt of being perfect. And then he'll smile with wisdom,  content that he realized the world isn't perfect. We're flawed because  we want so much more. Weâ€™re ruined because we get these things and wish for what we had." -Don Draper
