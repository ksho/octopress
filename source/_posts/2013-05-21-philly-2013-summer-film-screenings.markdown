Outdoor summer films in Philly.. as usual, most of them show on Thursdays. Here's a chart to help you decide where to be each week.

#### Schuylkill Banks
- All films start at dusk, between 7:45 and 8:30.
- I've marked each film in the Schuylkill Banks column with their location along the river:
    - Walnut Street (WS)
    - Grays Ferry Crescent (GF)
    - Paine's Park (PP)


#### Drexel Park
- All films begin at dusk, which is around 8 p.m. in June and July and 8:30 p.m. in August.

#### Penn's Landing
- Screenings begin at dusk (between 8-8:30pm)
