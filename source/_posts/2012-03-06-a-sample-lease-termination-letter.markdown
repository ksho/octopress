As a direct result of my concerns regarding an increase in my rent not being addressed in any way, I will be terminating my lease effective April 30, 2012.

You should know my decision to leave has not been influenced by the quality of my apartment, my neighbors, or the desk/maintenance staff, as my experience at The Metropolitan has overall been a positive one. In spite of this, the shortsightedness of management making no approach to compromise will not allow me to stay.

I expect we will do a final walkthrough prior to my departure, so please contact me with any items you need from me to fulfill the end of my lease agreement.
