I did a quick recording of The World Spins Madly On by The Weepies.  It was tracked all in one shot, guitar and vocals together (though I added some harmonies toward the end).  Setup was as follows..

[Studio Projects B3](http://www.studioprojects.com/b3.html) for vocals
[AKG Perception 220](http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,1055,nodeid,2,_language,EN,pid,1055.html) on the soundhole
[Shure SM57](http://www.shure.com/proaudio/products/wiredmicrophones/us_pro_sm57-lc_content) on the fingerboard

Enjoy!
