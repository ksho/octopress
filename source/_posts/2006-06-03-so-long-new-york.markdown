My flight for Madison leaves tomorrow at 1:59pm.  I should arrive there around 5:30.  Everything seems to be in order... my bags are all packed.  My only worry really is the handling of my guitar throughout the trip.  Hopefully they'll let me just carry it on the plane... I have it stored in the backpack case, so this makes for a more inconspicuous passing through the gates and various checkpoints.

An intern from the human resource department will be meeting me at MSN (the Madison airport abbreviation) to transport me back to my apartment.  I have high hopes for my new living space.  You can check out my space here at the [apartment company's website](http://www.jsmproperties.com/gorham/121-3.pdf).

The following is the address for my apartment if any of you feel compelled to send perfume dipped letters:

121 E. Gorham #3
Madison, WI 53715

I won't have a computer for the next week or so since Villanova doesn't expect them to arrive until June 12.  Until then I will have computer access at work from 9-5, so I will attempt to take care of all necessary emailing/interneting during this time.  I'll keep in touch via the usual methods as well keeping the blog updated.  Alrighty... talk to you soon.
