The last of my Russian River Damnation at the new Tria Taproom. Though we all had a good time, I'll likely continue to spend more time at their Wash West location this winter rather than making the trek to 20th and Walnut.

First visit cliffs notes:  
- More space than the other two locations  
- First Tria with an actual kitchen  
- At least 20ish beers on draft  
- Decor is a bit colder than their Sansom and Spruce spots -- a lot of chrome, dark wood, grey marble, and white painted brick.  
- Will the iPad menus stick?
