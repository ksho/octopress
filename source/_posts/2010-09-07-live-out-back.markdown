Back in August, we had a bbq, and ended up putting on a little impromptu show.  These are selections from that day.  The balance is a bit rough around the edges, but I sorta like how you can hear dogs, cicadas, various aircraft, and other fun things in the background.  Credits to Alan on mandolin, Brian on guitar, Eric on bongos, and Joe on rhymes in Change the World.  Enjoy!
