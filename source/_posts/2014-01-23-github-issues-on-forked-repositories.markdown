Sometime last week, I wanted to open an issue on [my repository for this site](https://github.com/ksho/octopress), which itself is a fork of [octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress), but couldn't for the life of me find the issues page I've seen on most other repos. Could it be that [Github Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation) are only supported on non-fork repositories? After some digging, it turns out [forked repos require the _Issues_ option be enabled in Settings](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/179468/forking-a-repo-on-github-but-allowing-new-issues-on-the-fork). Is there a good reason this isn't turned on by default?
