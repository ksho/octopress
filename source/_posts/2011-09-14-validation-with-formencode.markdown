I gave a talk at [PhillyPUG](http://www.meetup.com/phillypug/) (hosted at Monetate!) last night discussing how you can easily implement validation in your app with a python library called [formencode](http://www.formencode.org). You can find the code and accompanying slides here.. [https://github.com/kmano8/validationtalk](https://github.com/kmano8/validationtalk).
