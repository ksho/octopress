I come up with strange rules for myself sometimes.  One of the big ones over the last few years has been keeping the frequency I listen to certain songs in check for fear of killing a good one -- we've all done this.. think back to hearing Kryptonite on the radio one too many times in ninth grade.  I'll also keep from hitting the Christmas tunes hard until December starts -- if I listened to Karen Carpenter year round, it would ruin the flashbacks I get decorating the tree back in nineties, and that would be a big problem for me.  Please note that Ke$ha is immune to this phenomenon.

Anyway, I broke a rule this morning.  When Alan and I went to Tennessee back in 2007, I had my first cappuccino, and it was something of an other world.  When I went to visit Mike in San Diego last year, I had another.  And so I started to drink cappuccino only when I went on vacation.. two more times I got out to San Diego, once to Dallas, Houston, and various other smaller trips in between.  The drink has become part of my vacation experience.  This morning though, I'm drinking cappuccino--I feel so dangerous.  It's an unusual day though, so I don't think breaking the rules will ruin my vacation treat.
