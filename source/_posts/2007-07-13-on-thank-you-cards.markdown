Tradition in the United Sates — and perhaps beyond… I’m not sure — says when receiving a gift, proper etiquette is to reciprocate by sending a thank you card.  This process is difficult for most, and can be compared to the procastonation associated with completing taxes.  Although once I began college, this process ceased.  Let me suggest why the thank you card is an unneccesary self-esteem booster.

Firstly — there aren’t many personal relationships that involve one way gift-giving.  Although this is unwritten rule, I have a general idea of who I would exchange gifts with for birthday’s, Christmas, etc.  Person X and Y are graduating classmates.  Person X goes to person Y’s graduation party and gives him a monetary gift.  Person Y then goes to person X’s graudation party and also presents him with a gift of modest value.  Person X and person Y write each other thank you letters.  Why?  Isn’t it enough that you each received a gift already?  And not only did you receive a gift… a card was most likely attached.  So to recap, when the process is all said and done, the gift exchanging process between two people for a single event produces six items!

The superfluous receipt of two cards for a special occassion is silly, and quite simply a waste of trees.
