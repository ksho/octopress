I was in St. Augustine's church last weekend rehearsing for an upcoming wedding, and had a bit of extra time, so I did one take of this Train classic.  One mic for vocals, one inside the piano pointed down toward the lower octaves.  Vocals are shaky in spots, but what is great about this recording is how little I did to the sound.  The combination of a great piano in a great room is noticeable.  Enjoy!
