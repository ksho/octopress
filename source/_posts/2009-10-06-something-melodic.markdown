This year, I've been trying to write more.  Even if much of it comes out like garbage, I think it's all part of the process. My goal for 2009 was to have enough material written to put out my first album, but without full-time attention, trying to create something I am proud of would be unrealistic. That said, I think it's a fair compromise to have an EP done in the next few months. We'll take it from here.
