Another week has swiftly come and gone. It’s incredible how quickly my summer is progressing, and to think I will be back at Villanova in only a few short weeks. Although I only have about two and a half weeks at home before I head back to school, I have a few things planned to round out the summer. I remember my parents talking to me about Madison back in January when I still hadn’t decided what I was going to do, and they reminded me that although it is a great opportunity to be offered an internship, I shouldn’t forget that it is supposed to be my summer vacation. Only now do I realize that two months of my summer has come and gone quite quickly. I don’t have any regrets, but I do wonder what would’ve come of my summer had I stayed on the island.

In other news, I’ve been playing quite a bit of Need for Speed: Most Wanted on my X360, and I must say that being chased by the cops at 140mph is an experience that no person should go without. That being said, the game is quite pretty to look at.

Ok, my code summons me. Stay classy east coast.

-Karl out.
