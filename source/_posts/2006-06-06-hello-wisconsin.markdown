I arrived here in Madison on Saturday... the weather was hot, almost unbearable.  Me and the guys from Villanova spent the weekend getting acquianted with the area.  Madison is a quiant little city.  There is no traffic, the streets are clean and many restaurants line the main drag up to the Capitol (the building, that is).

Sonic Foundry's office is a half mile from my apartment, so ten minutes gives me plenty of time to get to my desk in the morning.  I'm on the seventh floor.  The work is going to be good... I'm quite excited.

My experience here as a whole has been quite positive in the few days I have been here, and I expect it to only get better as I become more familiar with my role at Sonic.  Hope all is well by everyone.  Drop me a line if you feel so inclined.  It would be nice to hear from some familiar voices.
