My Uncle (and godfather), Ken Shouler, is an author, sportswriter, and philosophy professor -- he can also be credited with encouraging my pool playing abilities. Â Recently, I've been working on a project with him to get his web presence up and running.  You can check him out at [kenshouler.com](http://www.kenshouler.com), where you'll find his books, articles, and a continuing commentary on one of his specialties, the philosophy of sport.  Enjoy!
