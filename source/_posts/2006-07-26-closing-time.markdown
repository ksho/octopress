I’m slowly but surely packing up my belongings in anticipation of my flight back to New York on Saturday morning. I shipped my Xbox and some books home today to avoid the charge for checking overweight luggage at the airport. It was a heavy box indeed that had to be 30 pounds. Between that and it’s size, it was a dreadful pain to carry from my apartment to my office. It’ll be nice to be able to write it off as an expense instead of being charged $25 by the airline. I sure hope it gets to Smithtown in one piece.

As I’ve been going through my apartment I’ve realized my kitchen still has quite a bit of food stuffs in it, so I decided that my best bet would be to put it in a box and give it to one of the guys who hang out on the sidewalk asking for change. I usually give them my spare change. Although I prefer to give it to the guys that do something. My favorite has to be the man who plays the drums on those white buckets on the corner of State and Broom. He’s out around lunchtime everyday, and I will usually save my change from lunch for him when I walk by. I suppose I don’t know what they’re doing with the money. Perhaps they’re buying alcohol and drugs with it, but in my world of vast meadows and butterscotch candies they are spending it on food for themselves and their families. That being said, hopefully my leftover food will go to good use.
