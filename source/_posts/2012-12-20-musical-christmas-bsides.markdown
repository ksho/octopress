Last year, at our Christmas concert at St. Augustine's, we had some technical difficulties with our audio recording, which rendered many of the tracks lost. Through the group's crazy amount of dedication, and a little luck in our schedules, we reassembled in January, and re-recorded some of the missing material. Sorry it took me so long, but here it is cleaned, mixed, and ready for download.
