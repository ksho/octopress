Over the past few weeks, I have been looking to set up my desktop linux as dual-boot with my WinXP installation.  I’ve tried many distributions in the past, and I always favored Ubuntu the most — it put through the least amount of pain when getting all of my hardware to work.  So I partioned my HD to my liking:

[Windows: 40gb][media: 70gb][FAT32 transfer: 15gb][/home: 22gb][root: 22gb][swap: 3gb]

Install of Ubuntu 7.04 took about 30 minutes or so, and there were 90 updates available first boot.  I had to manually fiddle with some settings to get my sound and my screen resolution working.  No problem though.  I installed beryl, and it is absolutely beautiful as far as desktop effects go.

Fast forward to me getting sleepy.  I shut down ubuntu and went to sleep.  However, I wake up this morning, and my computer is still on.  In turning the monitor on, I find that ubuntu got stuck shutting down in what looked like the most absolute last step before the power turns off.  Very strange.  Trying to reboot and shutdown again yeilds the same results.  A bit frustrating, but something I can deal with.

Also, I have to say that the Ubuntu community is the most helpful place I’ve ever found on the internet.  They are quick and clear in helping to resolve issues other users encounter.  Splendid.

Unfortunately, I’m posting this from my Windows machine at work ![:)](http://karlshouler.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
