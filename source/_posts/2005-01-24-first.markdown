So I figured that I would get this project going again. This is for a few reasons. Mainly, it's for myself. I've always been a mediocre writer, and I feel that this can help me excel in that area. I suppose engineers aren't meant to write... haha. Firstly, I would like to share my snowy weekend at Villanova.

We got well over a foot of snow this weekend here in the Radnor Township of Pennsylvania. It was cold, slushy and sandy... but nice from the great indoors. Although it would've been nice if the snow gods decided Sunday was more apt for a blizzard. A brand new week is upon me. My first Monday of the semester, and my busiest day of any given week. It's alright though because I really do enjoy going to class. It's just hard finding the motivation to get out of bed and take a shower, only to be greeted by the subzero temperatures eagerly waiting outside the doors of Stanford. Well, this has been fulfilling. Off to get some shut eye and hopefully learn something new this week. Happy Birthday Tom. Goodnight.
